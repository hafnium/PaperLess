\section{Implementation and Results}

\remark{Explain exactly what we accomplished and how we measured our
  success. Should describe the test cases that we used and how we
  verified the system. Make mention that we failed in some areas but
  direct the attention of the reader to the discussion section instead
  of spelling it out here.}
