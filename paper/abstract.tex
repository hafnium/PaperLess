\begin{abstract}
  We describe PaperLess, an electronic receipt processing system. Our
  approach is to provide a seamless integration to existing point of
  sale (POS) systems. Our system is designed to withstand spikes in
  demand and faults from hardware and connectivity. We describe our
  system and the ways in which we accomplished each of our goals. The
  final product is an integrated system that allows consumers and
  sellers to effortlessly access their receipts without needing a
  physical copy.
