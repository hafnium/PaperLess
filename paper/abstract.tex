As the world becomes more environmentally conscious, it becomes increasingly necessary to revise the financial transaction infrastructure to accommodate the trend.  Although paper receipts create very little waste on a per transaction basis, the volume of receipts being printed daily has a negative effect on the environment.  The Paperless system aims to reduce this wastefullness by providing customers with the option of receiving a digital receipt in place of its paper counterpart.  Customers can then access their digital receipts through the Paperless system via an online web interface.  The Paperless system allows for an environmentally friendly alternative to paper receipts with the added benefeit of a scallable distributed backend capable of compiling statistical data on customer purchasing activity.
