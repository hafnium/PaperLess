\caption[]{\textbf{Rapid Collaborative Refinement} By closing the
  short-term iteration loop our team was able to efficiently develop
  critical pieces of the system. The rapid switching between code in
  seclusion and collaborating to uncover and resolve problems allowed
  us to very quickly refine aspects of the system.}
