\section{Future Work}

\remark{How we envision the system behaving in the future. Mention the
  possibility of interfacing with the POS system directly OR (and I
  think this is important), how we might improve the OCR package
  ourselves. In a sense we kind of know what we're looking for when we
  OCR a receipt.}
