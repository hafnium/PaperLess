\section{System Overview}

\remark{Describe the server architecture (RPC, Sockets, etc). Also
desribe the distributed nature of the whole system. MySQL
server. Gateway. Redundancy. Basically tie in the information from the
requirements section. This section should read like the specification
but not be as formal. Make sure to ref the spec document though. Maybe
take some time to discuss out Rapid Collaborative Refinement
procedure.}
