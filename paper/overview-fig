\caption[]{\textbf{System Overview} Our system consists of three main parts: a gateway, a processing group, and a data warehousing group. The gateway accepts receipt requests from a point of sale (POS) system and passes them on to the processing group (RP's). Once a receipt has been processed it is passed to the data warehousing group to be stored on one of the data nodes (M's) for future use.}
